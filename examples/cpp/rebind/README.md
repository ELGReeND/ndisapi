# rebind

Rebinds outgoing TCP/UDP connections for the specified application from the default network interface to a different one. 

## Description
For example, we have a host on our home network connected to LAN (192.168.100.25/24) and Wi-Fi (192.168.100.165/24) at the same time. By default, Windows will use the LAN interface (192.168.100.25) to connect to the Internet, the Wi-Fi interface will be idle. Rebind allows you to redirect TCP/UDP connections for a selected application (e.g. Firefox) over Wi-Fi (instead of LAN) while other applications continue to use the LAN.
